  <h3>SnippetRunner Common Interface </h3>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">The SnippetRunner Common Interface extends the usability and functionality of SnippetRunner, and it provides uniformity and availability across platforms. It works as a front end for communicating commands triggered by user interactions to the SnippetRunner serverand intepreting feedback from the server as a result of executing commands. See <a href="Using_the_Common_Interface.htm#XREF_24853_Using_the_Common"><span class="FM_HyperText">Using the Common Interface</span></a>&#160;for information about its features and usage.</p>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">The Common Interface was first introduced as a Java application with the Acrobat 7.0 SDK for Linux (on which Acrobat Reader was available), and was subsequently shipped with Acrobat 7.0 and PDF Library 7.0 SDKs.</p>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">The initial releases (versions 1.0 and 1.5) of the Common Interface were Java applications that required a platform-specific Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to be properly installed and accessible. The recommended JVM was the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available for download from Sun Microsystems, Inc. </p>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">The SnippetRunner Common Interface that was shipped with the Acrobat 8.0 SDK was a rewrite of the previous version with Adobe Flex™ 2 technology, taking advantage of the high-performance Adobe Flash® 9.0 player engine to achieve cross-platform availability while eliminating the need for a Java VM on your system. As modern web sites make substantial use of Flash technology for their site content, it is very likely that you already have the Flash player plug-in installed for your browser. </p>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">In the Acrobat 9.0 SDK, the Common Interface went a step further by taking advantage of the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR), which enables convenient and configuration of the Common Interface and eliminates the need to use a browser, while preserving the familiar user interface in a desktop application.</p>
  <h4><a name="TOC_Installing_the_Common"></a>Installing the Common Interface</h4>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">For the Acrobat SDK, the Common Interface is delivered as an Adobe AIR application. See <span class="FM_HyperText"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/air">http://www.adobe.com/go/air</a></span>&#160;to download and install the free Adobe AIR runtime. Once the runtime has been installed, double-click the CommonInterfaceAIR.air file located in your Acrobat SDK installation.</p>
  <p class="BodyLevel1">For the PDF Library SDK, you will continue using the Java-based Common Interface, so make sure you have the Java VM properly installed. If you already have a JDK installed, you do not need a separate JVM for the SnippetRunner Common Interface. If you are specifically installing one for this application, the J2SE 1.4.2 (or 1.5) JRE from Sun Microsystems is recommended.</p>
