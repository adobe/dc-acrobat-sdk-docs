Navigators

**Description**


These samples get you started with Navigator development. Other than the TileView sample, the samples serve as snippets that address only specific features they demonstrate.

-  Starter contains only the required property INavigator.set host() and some functions to take care of the race condition when a Navigator is initialized. It can serve as a framework for your Navigator development.
-  ReadWriteResources is a sample that demonstrates how to add resources to a portfolio and how to read and write the contents of the navigator custom resource that exists for the given path.
-  ApplyColorPalette demonstrates how to apply a suggested palette of colors for the navigator.
-  GetLocalizedString shows how to use localized string in navigators.
-  TileView is a navigator that has folder navigation and uses the Acrobat API to feed thumbnails to an item renderer. You can use the context menu to view or manipulate the portfolio. Drag and drop only support drag into the current directory.
-  TrivialDragDrop demonstrates how to drag and drop to the current directory of the navigator.
-  DragOut extends TrivialDragDrop sample to support drag from portfolio to the OS.
-  DragWithin extends DragOut sample to support drag into sub-folders.
-  CheckPermission demonstrates how to set certain functionalities of a navigator based on permissions granted.
-  SimpleSort demonstrates how to set and get sorting in a navigator.

**Usage**


Switch workspace and point to SDK sample NavigatorSupport directory.

Import the Samples to your workspace.

The Navs folder contains the .nav files for the samples and their corresponding folders containing resouces needed to build the .nav files. You can use your favorite zip tool to modify the content of the .nav file.

When it is time for you to choose a layout, select SDK Sample Layouts. All the SDK sample Navigators are under that category.
