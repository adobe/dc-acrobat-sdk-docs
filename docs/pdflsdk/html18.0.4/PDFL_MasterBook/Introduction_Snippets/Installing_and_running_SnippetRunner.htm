  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_3Head"><a name="XREF_91750_Installing_and"></a>Installing and running SnippetRunner</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">SnippetRunner consists of a set of files, organized into folders in the Samples\SnippetRunner\ directory of the Acrobat SDK or PDF Library SDK. The directory includes the following files:</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>Source code files for the SnippetRunner server. These files are located in the Sources\platform\ directory. For each platform, there is a project file you can use to compile SnippetRunner along with the SDK header files. It consists of a .vcproj file for Microsoft® Windows®, a .xcodeproj file for Mac OS, and makefiles for UNIX® platforms. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>SnippetRunner environment and utility files. These files are located in the Sources\platform\Acrobat (for the Acrobat SDK only) and Sources\platform\Shared directories. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>Individual code snippets. Each of these is intended to demonstrate one or more APIs. Each snippet exists as a single, separate file within the Sources\snippets\Acrobat (for the Acrobat SDK only) or Sources\snippets\Shared directory, and is included in the SnippetRunner project. If you build your own snippets (see <a href="../Writing_Snippets/Writing_Snippets.htm#XREF_57730_Writing_Snippets"><span class="FM_HyperText">Writing Snippets</span></a>), you can add them to the SnippetRunner project and rebuild the project. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>External files required by snippets. These are in the ExampleFiles directory and can be sample files for input or resources for user interface components. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">Before using the SnippetRunner, you need to build it in the appropriate manner for your platform. For the Acrobat SDK, after the SnippetRunner project is built, the SnippetRunner Server plug-in must be installed in the appropriate plug_ins directory so that it will be loaded by Acrobat when it is launched. It will be copied automatically after being built if the <span class="FM_Courier">AcroSDKPIDir</span>&#160;environment variable is defined, or it may be copied manually. For the PDF Library, the SnippetRunnerServer application will be executed when the Common Interface is launched (see <a href="#XREF_17596_Starting_the"><span class="FM_HyperText">Starting the Common Interface for the PDF Library</span></a>). </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_4Head"><a name="TOC_SnippetRunner_Common"></a>SnippetRunner Common Interface </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The SnippetRunner Common Interface extends the usability and functionality of SnippetRunner, and it provides uniformity and availability across platforms. It works as a front end for communicating commands triggered by user interactions to the SnippetRunner serverand intepreting feedback from the server as a result of executing commands. See <a href="Using_the_Common_Interface.htm#XREF_24853_Using_the_Common"><span class="FM_HyperText">Using the Common Interface</span></a>&#160;for information about its features and usage.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The Common Interface was first introduced as a Java application with the Acrobat 7.0 SDK for Linux (on which Adobe Reader was available), and was subsequently shipped with Acrobat 7.0 and PDF Library 7.0 SDKs.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The initial releases (versions 1.0 and 1.5) of the Common Interface were Java applications that required a platform-specific Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to be properly installed and accessible. The recommended JVM was the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available for download from Sun Microsystems, Inc. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The SnippetRunner Common Interface that was shipped with the Acrobat 8.0 SDK was a rewrite of the previous version with Adobe Flex™ 2 technology, taking advantage of the high-performance Adobe Flash® 9.0 player engine to achieve cross-platform availability while eliminating the need for a Java VM on your system. As modern web sites make substantial use of Flash technology for their site content, it is very likely that you already have the Flash player plug-in installed for your browser. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">In the Acrobat 9.0 SDK, the Common Interface went a step further by taking advantage of the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR), which enables convenient and configuration of the Common Interface and eliminates the need to use a browser, while preserving the familiar user interface in a desktop application.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_4Head"><a name="TOC_Installing_the_Common"></a>Installing the Common Interface</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">For the Acrobat SDK, the Common Interface is delivered as an Adobe AIR application. See <span class="FM_HyperText"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/air">http://www.adobe.com/go/air</a></span>&#160;to download and install the free Adobe AIR runtime. Once the runtime has been installed, double-click the CommonInterfaceAIR.air file located in your Acrobat SDK installation.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">For the PDF Library SDK, you will continue using the Java-based Common Interface, so make sure you have the Java VM properly installed. If you already have a JDK installed, you do not need a separate JVM for the SnippetRunner Common Interface. If you are specifically installing one for this application, the J2SE 1.4.2 (or 1.5) JRE from Sun Microsystems is recommended.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_4Head"><a name="TOC_Starting_the"></a>Starting the SnippetRunner and the Common Interface</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The SnippetRunner back-end server must be started prior to starting the Common Interface front end to ensure the establishment of socket communication channels. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">When running snippets as plug-ins, you must launch Acrobat or Adobe Reader before starting the Common Interface. As long as you have copied the SnippetRunnerServer plug-in file to the plug_ins directory of Acrobat or Adobe Reader, the SnippetRunner server loads on application launch and starts listening on a port designated for socket connection requests. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">When running snippets using the PDF Library SDK, you can start up the Common Interface (see <a href="#XREF_17596_Starting_the"><span class="FM_HyperText">Starting the Common Interface for the PDF Library</span></a>). This automatically starts the PDF Library SnippetRunner application prior to attempting to establish a socket communication channel, so no manual invocation is required.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_4Head"><a name="TOC_Starting_the_Common"></a><a name="XREF_17596_Starting_the"></a>Starting the Common Interface for the PDF Library</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">This section describes how to start the Java version of the Common Interface to be used with the PDF Library SDK.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">You may load the Common Interface as a standalone Java application or as a Java applet. The following sections describe the procedures for each of these cases. The Common Interface is packaged as a Java Archive (JAR) file containing Java byte code (class files) and associated resources. This file is CommonInterface.jar in the <span class="FM_Courier">SnippetRunner</span>&#160;folder. The JAR format provides for resource integrity and also allows the content of the archive to be digitally signed, which is required so that the Common Interface can be certified to run as an applet by a web browser's JVM. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_4Head"><a name="TOC_Creating_the"></a>Creating the configuration file </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The first time the Common Interface is invoked, a configuration file (pdflsdk.config) is automatically generated and stored in the user's home directory. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">To ensure that the contents of this file are created accurately, you must launch the Common Interface from its installed location in the SnippetRunner folder so that a <span class="FM_Italic">base</span>&#160;directory (a platform-specific absolute path to the SnippetRunner folder) can be properly written to the file. This path is used by the Common Interface to locate reference files and snippet source code at run time. Once this configuration file is written, the Common Interface can be invoked from any folder location. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">If a path other than that of the SnippetRunner folder is written to the configuration file, the Common Interface will not function properly. If this occurs, delete the configuration file and restart the Common Interface from its base directory. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_5Head">Running as a standalone Java application </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">This section explains how you can run the Common Interface as a standalone Java application.</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_6HeadStep"><span class="FM_Z_Arrow">ä<span style="padding-left: 8pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>To run the client as a standalone Java application: </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Step"><span style="padding-left: 66pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span>1.<span style="padding-left: 2pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_2"></span>From a terminal or console window, switch to the directory where the CommonInterface.jar file resides (the SnippetRunner directory). </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Step"><span style="padding-left: 66pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span>2.<span style="padding-left: 2pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_2"></span>Execute the following command: <span class="FM_Courier">console&gt;java -jar -cp . CommonInterface.jar</span>&#160;</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">On Windows and Mac OS, you can also double-click the CommonInterface.jar icon to launch the Common Interface. (This procedure assumes that the JAR file extension has not been associated with other applications after your JDK/JRE installation.) The SnippetRunner Common Interface should begin running very soon thereafter. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_5Head">Running as a Java applet </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">To run the Common Interface client as a Java applet, you must digitally sign the JAR file before loading the client into your web browser. This requires the <span class="FM_Courier">keytool</span>&#160;and <span class="FM_Courier">jarsigner</span>&#160;command-line utilities from the J2SE Development Kit (or equivalent). </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_6HeadStep"><span class="FM_Z_Arrow">ä<span style="padding-left: 8pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>To sign the CommonInterface.jar file for running as an applet: </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Step"><span style="padding-left: 66pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span>1.<span style="padding-left: 2pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_2"></span>Generate a public/private key pair and the self-signed certificate. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Step"><span style="padding-left: 66pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span>2.<span style="padding-left: 2pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_2"></span>Sign the JAR file with the private key. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Step"><span style="padding-left: 66pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span>3.<span style="padding-left: 2pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_2"></span>Load the signed client into your browser. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">To generate a public/private key pair and the self-signed certificate, execute a command similar to this from a console using the <span class="FM_Courier">keytool</span>&#160;utility: </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_CodeReference">console&gt;keytool -genkey -alias <span class="FM_CourierItalic">EntryAlias</span>&#160;-keypass <span class="FM_CourierItalic">EntryPassword</span>&#160;</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">where <span class="FM_CourierItalic">EntryAlias</span>&#160;is a name you want to assign for this key pair entry in the keystore and <span class="FM_CourierItalic">EntryPassword</span>&#160;is a password required to guard against that key entry. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">You will be prompted for the keystore password of your choice and some information to incorporate into the self-signed certificate. The newly generated public/private key pair and the self-signed certificate will be saved in the keystore file in the default location. Refer to the JDK Security Tools documentation for details on the keystore. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">To sign the JAR file with the private key, issue a command similar to the following from a console using the <span class="FM_Courier">jarsigner</span>&#160;utility: </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_CodeReference"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>console&gt;jarsigner -storepass <span class="FM_CourierItalic">StorePass</span>&#160;-keypass <span class="FM_CourierItalic">KeyPass</span> CommonInterface.jar<br /><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="FM_CourierItalic">EntryAlias</span>&#160;</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">where <span class="FM_CourierItalic">StorePass</span>&#160;is the keystore password assigned while creating the public/private key pair entry in the previous step. <span class="FM_CourierItalic">KeyPass</span>&#160;is the key pair entry password assigned in the previous step. <span class="FM_CourierItalic">EntryAlias</span>&#160;is the name assigned to the key pair entry in the previous step. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">This completes the applet signing process in preparation for the Common Interface to be run as an applet by the JVM plug-in of the platform browser. The signed JAR file contains a copy of the certificate from the keystore for the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the JAR file. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">Now that you have signed the JAR file, load the provided HTML page CommonInterface.html (in the SnippetRunner folder) into your default browser. This page is an applet starter page that marks up the applet properties. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">Accept the certificate to allow the browser JVM plug-in to execute the applet byte code. The Common Interface should begin running soon thereafter, and you can interact with it within the boundary of the browser window. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_4Head"><a name="TOC_Known_issues"></a>Known issues</p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Body">The following issues pertain to the Java-based Common Interface. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>The socket communication between the SnippetRunner server and client may be lost during the operating system’s sleep mode. To re-establish communication, restart the Common Interface. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>If you start the Acrobat process by loading a PDF document into the web browser plug-in, the Common Interface socket communication will carry on with that process, which is most likely not expected. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>Currently, only Internet Explorer supports resizable content. All other browsers render the Common Interface at a fixed dimension. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>On Mac OS X, if you minimize the Common Interface window to the Dock and then bring it back into view, the Common Interface window might not be properly repainted. Resize the window to force the GUI to refresh. </p>
  <p dir="ltr" class="FM_Bullet1"><span class="FM_Z_Bullet">•<span style="padding-left: 12pt;" class="FMAutoNumber_1"></span></span>On Windows, an Acrobat dialog box triggered as a result of a command issued by the Common Interface may not come up to the top of all open windows, in which case the Common Interface may seem frozen. Open Acrobat to dismiss the dialog box. </p>
